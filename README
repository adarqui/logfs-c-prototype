built to capture everything send to 'logserv' via zmq. Needs an 'upstream' zmq connections which it writes to.

example usage:
-------------'

	mkdir -p /tmp/logs
	./logserv /tmp/logs/
	UPSTREAM="tcp://127.0.0.1:1010" PREFIX="localhost" ./logfs -o intr -o nonempty -o allow_other /var/log
	pkill -HUP -f syslog


testing logserv:
---------------'

./test-logserv


building:
--------'

make


environment variables:
---------------------'

UPSTREAM=

	specifies the 'upstream zmq connection' which logs are sent to


concept:
-------'

	creates a mapping in which you can intercept everything written to /var/log (or some other directory you specify). None of the writes will persist to disk. Instead, they will quickly pass to an upstream zmq connection. If 'logserv' goes down, 1000 messages will be queued up. After 1000 are reached, messages are dropped. Once the zmq connection is re-established, all queue'd messages will be sent to logserv.
