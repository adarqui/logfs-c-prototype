built to capture everything written to /var/log. Needs an 'upstream' unix socket which t writes to. It writes the path & data as base64 encoded strings, in json format.

example usage:
-------------'

	nc -lU </path/to/unix/sock>
	UPSTREAM=</path/to/unix/sock> ./logfs -o nonempty -o allow_other /var/log
	pkill -HUP -f syslog


environment variables:
---------------------'

UPSTREAM=

	specifies the 'upstream unix domain socket' which the json messages are sent too

	by default, logfs will try and connect to: /var/run/mpassd.sock


concept:
-------'

	creates a mapping in which you can intercept everything written to /var/log (or some other directory you specify). None of the writes will persist to disk. Instead, they will quickly pass to an upstream daemon which does whatever you want: forwarding, queueing, parsing, etc. Just get the messages out of logfs pretty, fire & forget.


TODO:
----'

	possibly get rid of the base64 encoding in favor of something else.
